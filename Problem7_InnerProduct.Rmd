# Introduction

In this excersise, we will write a code to calculate inner product. If you have vectors, $A = (a_0, a_1,...,a_n )$ and $B=(a_0, a_1,...,a_n)$, a inner product of $A$ and $B$ is $A \cdot B = \sum^n_{i=0}a_ib_i$.


# Question

- write a function to culculate a inner product of one dimention vectors $A$ and $B$
- in this excersise, let `A <- c(6,4,6,8,9,1)` and `B <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)`
- it is useful 

# Solution

```{r}
A <- c(6,4,6,8,9,1)
B <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
A%*%B
```
